Visualizing Activation Maps for Age Detection

Description

This project focuses on visualizing activation maps to understand which image regions activate CNN filters for age detection. This helps in interpreting how the model processes input images and identifies relevant features.

Guidelines

Use any of your pre-trained CNN models for age detection.

The main goal is to generate and visualize activation maps for different layers of the network.

GUI implementation is not required.

The visualization can be done using libraries such as Matplotlib and OpenCV.

The project should support input images and generate heatmaps indicating activated regions.

Requirements

Python 3.x

TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the model used)

OpenCV

Matplotlib

NumPy
